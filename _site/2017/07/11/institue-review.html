<p>LAL-Orsay Comments for draft 1</p>

<p>1) General Comments</p>

<p>One can wonder if Phys.Rev.Letters is the right journal for a QCD study which
is not a “hot QCD topic “ (to my knowledge-apologies if it is a hot topic). The soft drop mass is used for example by CMS in isolating H to bb at high PT, but this is another story.. One can also note that the experimental data seem to suffer from large systematic uncertainties.</p>

<p>Otherwise, in general the paper is well written.</p>

<p>-Small typo running through the text: choose between “modeling” or “modelling” (maybe modelling since this is what is used in the figures).</p>

<p>2) Miscellaneous Comments</p>

<p>Title
..</p>

<p>Abstract 
..</p>

<p>Contents
L123 blablabla …</p>

<p>The model has two main parameters, Rcut and beta. In the analysis part,results are presented for 3 values of beta. but only one value of Rcut. At first sight, a more symmetric approach with 3 values for each would look more appropriate. Or an explanation should be given why only one value of Rcut is enough.</p>

<p>Another question which comes to mind is why no distinction is attempted between quark jets and gluon jets?
 The 2-jet final state chosen should have a proportion of each of them fixed by the parameters and the chosen phase space in eta and PT, but this information is somehow lacking.</p>

<p>L19 : « With a single number » not really
L43 “This level of precision for a jet substructure observable at  a hadron collider is unprecedented and is surpassed only by the calculation of thrust in e+e− “: this is a very strong statement, is someone else than us saying this ? reference ? 
L54 « left to right » ill-defined, especially given the vertical layout of Fig 1</p>

<p>L73 probably add « up to |eta|=5 »
L76: What is the motivation to use R=0.8 since R=1.0 is most commonly used in ATLAS?
L79: Currently there is no official jet calibration recommendation for antikt R=0.8 jets in ATLAS? Can you clarify which calibration steps are applied? Are in-situ corrections applied?
L82 why is it important to be in ID coverage ? Use of ID for jet not mentioned until now.
L89: What is the motivation to imposed a di-jet topology? Is a cut on the jet pt assymetry the best way to select di-jet topology? Would a selection on the 3rd jet pt and/or dPhi(jet1,jet2) be more efficient to select a di-jet topology?</p>

<p>L93 why this choice of rho^2 mixing ungroomed and groomed, is this a theorist recommendation ? can it be justified in one sentence ? 
L97: ref 54 refers to an introduction of PYTHIA 8.1. In the text it is just mentioned “PYTHIA” while in L98 you mention “PYTHIA 8.1”: what’s the difference? Different tune, version?

<p>Thank you for this nicely written paper. Please find a few comments below :</p>

<h2 id="analysis-related-questions-and-comments-">Analysis-related questions and comments :</h2>

<ul>
  <li>One can wonder if Phys.Rev.Letters is the right journal for a QCD study which

  <li>The model has two main parameters, zcut and beta. In the analysis part,results are presented for 3 values of beta. but only one value of zcut. At first sight, a more symmetric approach with 3 values for each would look more appropriate. Or an explanation should be given why only one value of zcut is enough.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Why no distinction is attempted between quark jets and gluon jets? The 2-jet final state chosen should have a proportion of each of them fixed by the parameters and the chosen phase space in eta and PT, but this information is somehow lacking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>L19 : « With a single number » seems to be a little bit reductive</li>
  <li>L43 : “This level of precision for a jet substructure observable at  a hadron collider is unprecedented and is surpassed only by the calculation of thrust in e+e− “: this is a very strong statement, is someone else than us saying this ? reference ?</li>
  <li>L54 : « left to right » is not be very clear, maybe reformulate this ?</li>
  <li>Formula 1) is different from that in ref 41 and 42, are they equivalent ? Is there a motivation for prefering an expression to another ?</li>
  <li>
    <table>

        <tr>
          <td>L73 : probably add « up to</td>

  <li>Fig 2 caption : This distribution presents rho^2, right ? as for Fig 3 ? Replace error with error bar, and experimental with systematical uncertainties ?</li>
  <li>Fig 2: In the legend, the green line corresponds to th PYTHIA 8.2 simulation. In the text, you only mention PYTHIA and additional radiation simulated with 8.1. Is it a typo in the legend?</li>
  <li>L164 « data falls somewhere in between » : on Fig 3, this is true only for beta=0, not 1 or 2. Or is this paragraph just for beta=0 ? (given that L165 starts with « As beta increases » ?</li>

<h2 id="textual-comments">Textual comments</h2>

<ul>
  <li>There is a small typo running through the text: choose between “modeling” or “modelling” (maybe modelling since this is what is used in the figures).</li>
  <li>Fig 2: ticks all around the frame are missing</li>
  <li>Fig 2: On the MC/Data pad, please remove the data points which are also set at 1 and show the uncertainty as a shaded area as in Fig. 3.</li>
  <li>Fig 2: On the data/MC pad, there are several points at exactly 1.2. They are likely out of scale. Could you adapt the y axis range?</li>
  <li>Fig 3: It seems that there is no error shown for Pythia, Sherpa and Herwig. If it is correct, please remove the shaded area on the legend.</li>
  <li>Fig 3: Please remove the data points in the lower pad</li>
</ul>
