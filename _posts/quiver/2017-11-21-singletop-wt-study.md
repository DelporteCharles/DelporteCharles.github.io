# Multiplicity of jets
* large jets multiplicity
![IMAGE](/images/q/IMAGE)

# Multiplicity of tags
* low tags multiplicity
![IMAGE](/images/q/IMAGE)

# Truth flavour of jets
* majority of bb events, but less than in ttbar events (85%) ...
* important fraction of bc
* ~ two times more cb events than bc

# Number of leptonic decays
* majority of semi-leptonic decays, of the same order of ttbar events
![IMAGE](/images/q/IMAGE)

## Semi-leptonic decays
* if a +top (6) is produced, the lepton comes majoritarily (84%) from the prompt W-

### Semi-leptonic decays with prompt W- decaying leptonically
* majoritarily tau leptons
![IMAGE](/images/q/IMAGE)
* in those events, there is no bc/cb asymetry

### Semi-leptonic decays with non-prompt W+ decaying leptonically
* majoritarily tau leptons, but more muons and electrons
![IMAGE](/images/q/IMAGE)
* if the non-prompt W+ decays leptonically :
  * more cb events than bb events
  * asymetry bc/cb enhanced
![IMAGE](/images/q/IMAGE)
* in events with the non-prompt W+ decaying leptonically, bb events when the bbar has some pT
![IMAGE](/images/q/IMAGE)
* in most cases, the bbar has low pT
