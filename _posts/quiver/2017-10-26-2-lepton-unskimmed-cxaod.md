* trigger issue ?

--> the trigger item “HLT_xe110_mht_L1XE50”, which is used for data periods data16D4E3 to data16F2L11 (run number >= 302872) is not filled in Tasneem’s CxAODs. This period of data represents 75% of the integrated luminosity : these events do not pass the trigger selection, hence a factor 1/4.
