LAL-Orsay Comments for draft 1

1) General Comments            


 One can wonder if Phys.Rev.Letters is the right journal for a QCD study which
is not a "hot QCD topic " (to my knowledge-apologies if it is a hot topic). The soft drop mass is used for example by CMS in isolating H to bb at high PT, but this is another story.. One can also note that the experimental data seem to suffer from large systematic uncertainties.

 Otherwise, in general the paper is well written.

-Small typo running through the text: choose between “modeling” or “modelling” (maybe modelling since this is what is used in the figures).

2) Miscellaneous Comments

 The model has two main parameters, Rcut and beta. In the analysis part,results are presented for 3 values of beta. but only one value of Rcut. At first sight, a more symmetric approach with 3 values for each would look more appropriate. Or an explanation should be given why only one value of Rcut is enough.

  Another question which comes to mind is why no distinction is attempted between quark jets and gluon jets?
 The 2-jet final state chosen should have a proportion of each of them fixed by the parameters and the chosen phase space in eta and PT, but this information is somehow lacking.

L19 : « With a single number » not really
L43 “This level of precision for a jet substructure observable at  a hadron collider is unprecedented and is surpassed only by the calculation of thrust in e+e− “: this is a very strong statement, is someone else than us saying this ? reference ? 
L54 « left to right » ill-defined, especially given the vertical layout of Fig 1

L73 probably add « up to |eta|=5 »
L76: What is the motivation to use R=0.8 since R=1.0 is most commonly used in ATLAS?
L79: Currently there is no official jet calibration recommendation for antikt R=0.8 jets in ATLAS? Can you clarify which calibration steps are applied? Are in-situ corrections applied?
L82 why is it important to be in ID coverage ? Use of ID for jet not mentioned until now.
L89: What is the motivation to imposed a di-jet topology? Is a cut on the jet pt assymetry the best way to select di-jet topology? Would a selection on the 3rd jet pt and/or dPhi(jet1,jet2) be more efficient to select a di-jet topology?

L93 why this choice of rho^2 mixing ungroomed and groomed, is this a theorist recommendation ? can it be justified in one sentence ? 
L97: ref 54 refers to an introduction of PYTHIA 8.1. In the text it is just mentioned “PYTHIA” while in L98 you mention “PYTHIA 8.1”: what’s the difference? Different tune, version?

# Draft for final comments

Thank you for this nicely written paper. Please find a few comments below :

## Analysis-related questions and comments :

- One can wonder if Phys.Rev.Letters is the right journal for a QCD study which
is not a "hot QCD topic " (to my knowledge-apologies if it is a hot topic). The soft drop mass is used for example by CMS in isolating H to bb at high PT, but this is another story.. One can also note that the experimental data seem to suffer from large systematic uncertainties.
- The model has two main parameters, zcut and beta. In the analysis part,results are presented for 3 values of beta. but only one value of zcut. At first sight, a more symmetric approach with 3 values for each would look more appropriate. Or an explanation should be given why only one value of zcut is enough.
- Why no distinction is attempted between quark jets and gluon jets? The 2-jet final state chosen should have a proportion of each of them fixed by the parameters and the chosen phase space in eta and PT, but this information is somehow lacking.

- L19 : « With a single number » seems to be a little bit reductive
- L43 : “This level of precision for a jet substructure observable at  a hadron collider is unprecedented and is surpassed only by the calculation of thrust in e+e− “: this is a very strong statement, is someone else than us saying this ? reference ? 
- L54 : « left to right » is not be very clear, maybe reformulate this ?
- Formula 1) is different from that in ref 41 and 42, are they equivalent ? Is there a motivation for prefering an expression to another ?
- L73 : probably add « up to |eta|=5 » for the acceptance in the forward region
- L76 : What is the motivation to use R=0.8 since R=1.0 is most commonly used in ATLAS?
- L79: Currently there is no official jet calibration recommendation for antikt R=0.8 jets in ATLAS? Can you clarify which calibration steps are applied? Are in-situ corrections applied?
- L82 : Why is it important to be in ID coverage ? Use of ID for jet not mentioned until now.
- L89 : What is the motivation to imposed a di-jet topology? Is a cut on the jet pt assymetry the best way to select di-jet topology? Would a selection on the 3rd jet pt and/or dPhi(jet1,jet2) be more efficient to select a di-jet topology?
- L93 : Why this choice of rho^2 mixing ungroomed and groomed, is this a theorist recommendation ? Can it be justified in one sentence ? 
- L97: ref 54 refers to an introduction of PYTHIA 8.1. In the text it is just mentioned “PYTHIA” while in L98 you mention “PYTHIA 8.1”: is there a difference in tune, version?
- Fig 2 caption : This distribution presents rho^2, right ? as for Fig 3 ? Replace error with error bar, and experimental with systematical uncertainties ?
- Fig 2: In the legend, the green line corresponds to th PYTHIA 8.2 simulation. In the text, you only mention PYTHIA and additional radiation simulated with 8.1. Is it a typo in the legend?
- L164 « data falls somewhere in between » : on Fig 3, this is true only for beta=0, not 1 or 2. Or is this paragraph just for beta=0 ? (given that L165 starts with « As beta increases » ?

## Textual comments

- There is a small typo running through the text: choose between “modeling” or “modelling” (maybe modelling since this is what is used in the figures).
- Fig 2: ticks all around the frame are missing
- Fig 2: On the MC/Data pad, please remove the data points which are also set at 1 and show the uncertainty as a shaded area as in Fig. 3.
- Fig 2: On the data/MC pad, there are several points at exactly 1.2. They are likely out of scale. Could you adapt the y axis range?
- Fig 3: It seems that there is no error shown for Pythia, Sherpa and Herwig. If it is correct, please remove the shaded area on the legend.
- Fig 3: Please remove the data points in the lower pad

Auxiliary material

- the captions of plots in the auxiliary material are minimal.
- In Fig-6 what is plotted (from 10^-5 to 1) does not look like a bin number (x-axis title).
