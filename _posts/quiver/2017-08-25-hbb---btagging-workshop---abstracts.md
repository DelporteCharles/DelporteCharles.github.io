* **ColourFlow abstract :**
A class of event superstructure variables exploits the colour flow between QCD partons and could be used to provide variables for discriminating signal from background events in the SM VH(bb) search. Quarks produced in the decay of a colour singlet such as the Higgs boson produce a different hadrons pattern than quarks originating from colour charged particles such as gluons, connected to the underlying event. In ATLAS, this effect can be measured from calorimeter clusters and from tracks matched to jets. "Colourflow" could find an application in the VH(bb) search, for which we performed preliminary feasibility studies.

* **Investigations on the Z+jets normalisation :**
In the context of the  0-lepton channel of the SM VH(bb) search, the theory prediction of the yield for the Zbb background is much lower than that required by the data. The Zbb background estimate from the 2-leptons channel can be used as a benchmark in order to understand the source of this discrepancy. Also, Madgraph is used as an alternative generator in order to seek for hints.
