This is an event display for one of the most significant 0 lepton analysis events in the SM VH(bb) analysis. We would like to make this public for EPS talks/posters.

Caption for one with track insert:

A 2-tag, 2-jet, 0-lepton event within the signal-like portion of the high pTV region BDTVH (Run 284213, Event 1927020336) is shown. The ETMiss, shown as a white dashed line, has a magnitude of 294.3 GeV. The two central high-pT b-tagged jets, shown as green and yellow bars corresponding to the energy deposition in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters respectively, have a pT of XX GeV and XX GeV. The dijet invariant mass of 136.9 GeV. Tracks with pT above 1 GeV are shown.Tracks in both jets form signatures compatible with the decay of a b-hadron. The BDTVH output is 0.67.  The excerpt shows three vertices and their associated tracks (with a pT cut of 1.5 GeV): the yellow circle represents the primary vertex and the two light blue circles the two secondary vertices compatible with the presence of b-decays.
